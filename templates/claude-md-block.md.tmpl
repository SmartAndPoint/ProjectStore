## projectstore agents

- **A feature-sized request opens a vault artifact before it opens an editor.**
  Analysis → placement (which epic, which story) → an ADR and/or spec when the
  "how" is non-trivial → `projectstore:critic` → only then implementation →
  `projectstore:reviewer`. "Feature-sized" is not a judgement about how the
  request was phrased — it is about what the work touches: if you are about to
  write across several source files, open the story first.
- **Report instruction conflicts; do not arbitrate them.** If a session-level or
  harness-level instruction contradicts this block, say so and ask which wins.
  Resolving it silently is how the contradiction becomes invisible to the person
  who could have settled it.
- When spawning any agent below, resolve its model from
  `.claude/projectstore.json` → `agents.per_agent.<name>.model ?? agents.default.model`,
  where `<name>` is the **bare** agent name (`critic` for `projectstore:critic`),
  and pass it as the spawn's model parameter. No key — pass nothing.
- After authoring or revising any vault artifact (ADR/research/epic/story) or
  design proposal: run the `projectstore:critic` agent on it before treating it final.
- Before implementing an epic/story: consult `projectstore:planner` — it plans
  against how prior epics map to the codebase (`code_refs`).
- After writing code, before commit / story-done: run `projectstore:reviewer` —
  it verifies the diff actually closes the story's acceptance criteria.
- When discussing vault contents, reference artifacts by their frontmatter
  `title:` (with their parent epic), never by session-invented shorthand.
